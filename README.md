# Interview 304



#### Project Description

Our project creates a portal for interviewees to book interviews with an employer, by selecting the best date, time, & location based on the intervieweesâ€™ needs. The interviewee can input their personal information, as well as update & delete their booking. The end-product also shows fun facts about the interviewer (such as the average difficulty of questions asked by each interviewer), which may help interviewees select the best-fit interview slots, through using more complicated SQL queries such as division or aggregation.
